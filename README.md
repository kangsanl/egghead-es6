# egghead-es6
 - This project includes basic settings for tranpiling ES6 to ES5, and for JavaScript Unit Test settings
 - I would update more examples from JS meetup(http://www.meetup.com/Santa-Barbara-JavaScript-Meetup/events/222301599/), egghead.io, and so on.

# How to run?
 - $npm install
 -- This will install needed plugins
 - $grunt
 -- This will run Karma Unit test, and transpile ES6 codes
